      <h4><u>Early life</u></h4>
      <p>I was born on 10th November 2001 in Harambee at Matter Hospital and grew up in Buruburu,Eastlands for a while before relocating to Embakasi when I was 4 years old. Growing up in a family background of teachers,I was pretty much delved deep into books and it eventually became a hobby. But later my interests shifted to other activities that seemed more amusing than reading text. My family is also a God-fearing one and so I never missed church in my childhood.....well.....except for unavoidable instances.I do not remember much else about my childhood except through multiple albums full of pictures of a mini me taken by my parents.</p>

   <span class="line1"><center>WHY PROGRAMMING AND WHY MORINGA</center></span>
   
   <div class="testbox2">
      <p>My interest in programming started when I was still in highschool.I wanted to learn programming as it was a tool I would later use in life to solve various problems that we face in our daily lives</p>
      <h><u>Reasons why I joined Moringa School</u></h>
      <p>I came to discover Moringa not so long ago via a newspaper article and I was immediately convinced that it would be the right place to be.Some of the motivators were as follows
      <ul>
           <li>Moringa has <span class="key">broken the monotomy of most universities'classroom setup</span> where a lecturer bombards the students with theory while ignoring the practical aspect</li>
           <li>Moringa provides <span class="key">technical mentors</span>who are always available to assist as compared to over 100 students relying on a single lecturer.</li>
           <li>Moringa provides a <span class= "key"> hands-on,digital and online curriculum</span> that is effective and easy to comprehend and which is online compared to books used by other univeristies</li>
           <li>Moringa provides a <span class="key">friendly learning environment</span> where the students engage in stand-ups and group pairs,which helps in socialization ang gives a sense of belonging</li>
      </ul>
