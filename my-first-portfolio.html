    <h4>Early life</h4>
      <div class="testbox">
          I was born in 10th November 2001 in Harambee at Matter Hospital and grew up in Buruburu,Eastlands for a while before relocating to Embakasi when I was 4 years old. Growing up in a family background of teachers,I was pretty much delved deep into books and it eventually became a hobby. But eventually my interests shifted to other things I found more amusing than reading text. My family is also a God-fearing one and so I never missed church in my childhood.....well.....except for unavoidable instances.I do not remember much else about my childhood except through multiple albums full of pictures of a mini me taken by my parents.</div>

    <h5>PERSONAL LIFE</h5>
    <h6>Hobbies</h6>
    <p>I have sereval hobbies,mainly sports oriented....which I've discovered over the years be it in school,at home and with my friends</p>
    <ol> 
        <li><strong>Soccer:</strong>  Since I started school,and was introduced to soccer,I've always found great satisfaction and fun in playing the sport.I was in both my primary and secondary school soccer teams where I showcased my skills</li>
        <li><strong>Handball:</strong>  I was introduced to this sport in highschool where I discovered it was a hidden talent.I quickly grasped the rules and our school's coaching style and was on the team in no time. I was the only for one in the main Handball Scool Team. I continued to evolve in the game and finished my highschool being one of the most outstanding players in the sport</li>
        <li><strong>Basketball:</strong> I gained interest in this sport through gaming and watching NBA games. In highschool I would fidget between soccer and basketball during over free time and so I bettered myself this way while still having fun</li>

      Mbappé features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series: on FIFA 18 he had the highest potential rating of 94.[98][99] His trademark goal celebration – posing with his arms folded and hands tucked under his armpits – was inspired by his younger brother Ethan who would celebrate in this manner when beating Kylian at FIFA.[94][100] The celebration appears in FIFA 19</div>
